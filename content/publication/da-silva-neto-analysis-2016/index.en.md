## In a nutshell
In this paper we identify two isoforms of uridine phosphorylases (UP) on the *Schistosoma mansoni* genome which share 92% of sequence identity. Despite the high sequence identity, we demonstrate experimentally that one isoform, *smUPa*, is a regular UP while the other, *smUPb*, is not. We also determinate the atomic structure of the *smUPa* (free and bound with different ligands) and  *smUPb* (free) by X-ray diffraction protein crystallography. The structural analyses reveal that a significant part of the isoforms sequence divergence occurs in the vicinity of the active site and one of those changes partially reduces the active site space for ligand binding. RNA expression analyses shows that both isoforms are expressed in different stages of the *Schistosoma mansoni* life cycle suggesting that *smUPb* have a metabolic role which remains a mystery to be solved.

## Implications ##
This findings are interesting for:

  * The *Schistosoma mansoni* nucleic acids metabolism
    * what the *smUPb* does and what is its metabolic role on the parasite life cycle?
  * The drug discovery
    * this enzyme is different from the human counterparts and is important for parasite metabolism, therefore the *smUPb* is a potential therapeutic target for drug discovery projects
  * protein sequence-structure relationship
    * this UP isoforms compose a curious and unlikely case in which two proteins have 92% of sequence identity but different biochemical functions.
