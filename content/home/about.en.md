# Hi,

I am a postdoctoral research assistant at [Laboratory of Structural Bioinformatics](https://lbs.cent.uw.edu.pl/), [CeNT-UW](https://cent.uw.edu.pl/en/) and my main research interest is to explore new mathematical and computational methods to solve biomedical and biotechnological challenges (check [my projects](#projects)). Also, I believe science should be accessible to everyone and that's why I am part of  [PODEntender](https://podentender.com/), a science popularization podcast.
